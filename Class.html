            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when
            an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        </p>
        <p class="green center">
            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
            remaining essentially unchanged 
        </p>            
        <p class="green center Katta">
            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
            sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
        </p>
        <p> is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable 
            content of a page when looking at its layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
